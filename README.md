# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Deployed app link
#### Frontend
https://cocky-montalcini-4d1f7b.netlify.app/
#### Backend
https://online-invitation-application.herokuapp.com/

### How this project made?

It is a react.js and node.js project. Where I used react.js for my frontend side.
For backend, I used node.js, express.js. 
I have used mail service for this app so, I need to install nodemailer for this service.
I have also used google payment gateway in this application too.

### What this project does

In the pandemic, only few people were allowed to attend the wedding. So,
I have created this application where I can send online invitation to my guests with
live stream of wedding and password.
Guests can login into our system with mail and provided password.
There is also an online payment service for Shagun.
